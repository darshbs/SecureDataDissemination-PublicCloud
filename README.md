# 🛡️ Secure Data Group Sharing and Dissemination with Attribute and Time Conditions in Public Cloud

This project was submitted in partial fulfilment of **BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY** in **COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING**, Under the guidance of Dr. V. SAMBASIVA RAO M.Tech., Ph.D.,  Batch 2018 - 2022 at ST. MARY’S ENGINEERING COLLEGE (AFFILIATED TO JNTUH, APPROVED BY AICTE, ACCREDITED BY NAAC).

##  📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on secure data sharing in a public cloud environment while enforcing attribute-based access control and time-bound conditions. The goal is to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data based on predefined attributes and time constraints.

## 💡 Key Features  
✅ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) – Ensures data access based on user roles, permissions, and attributes.  
✅ Time-Based Conditions – Restricts access based on predefined time windows.  
✅ Public Cloud Storage – Uses cloud infrastructure to store and manage data securely.  
✅ Secure Data Dissemination – Prevents unauthorized access and ensures data integrity.
