# 🛡️ Secure Data Group Sharing and Dissemination with Attribute and Time Conditions in Public Cloud

## Overview
This project focuses on secure data sharing in a public cloud environment while enforcing attribute-based access control and time-bound conditions. The goal is to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data based on predefined attributes and time constraints.

Features
✅ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) – Ensures data access based on user roles, permissions, and attributes.
✅ Time-Based Conditions – Restricts access based on predefined time windows.
✅ Public Cloud Storage – Uses cloud infrastructure to store and manage data securely.
✅ Secure Data Dissemination – Prevents unauthorized access and ensures data integrity.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: [Python/Java] (Specify the primary language)

Cloud Service: AWS / Google Cloud / Azure (Specify if applicable)

Encryption Methods: AES / RSA (Mention the security algorithms used)

Database: MySQL / MongoDB / Firebase (Specify the database if used)

Run the Application:

sh
Copy
Edit
python main.py  # If using Python
npm start  # If using Node.js
Usage
Upload Data: Users can upload data to the cloud with attribute-based and time-based restrictions.

Set Access Conditions: Define who can access the data and for how long.

Retrieve Data: Only authorized users within the allowed time frame can access the data.

Future Enhancements
🔹 Integration with blockchain for enhanced security
🔹 Real-time monitoring & auditing of access logs
🔹 Support for multi-cloud storage solutions
