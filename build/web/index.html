							<p>Cloud computing has become increasingly popular among users and businesses around the world. Although cryptographic techniques can provide data protection for users in public cloud, several issues also remain problematic, such as secure data group dissemination and fine-grained access control of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose an identity-based data group sharing and dissemination scheme in public cloud, in which data owner could broadcast encrypted data to a group of receivers at one time by specifying these receivers' identities in a convenient and secure way. In order to achieve secure and flexible data group dissemination, we adopt attribute-based and timed-release conditional proxy re-encryption to guarantee that only data disseminators whose attributes satisfy the access policy of encrypted data can disseminate it to other groups after the releasing time by delegating a re-encryption key to cloud server. The re-encryption conditions are associated with attributes and releasing time, which allows data owner to enforce fine-grained and timed-release access control over disseminated ciphertexts. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show our proposed scheme makes a tradeoff between computational overhead and expressive dissemination conditions.</p>
